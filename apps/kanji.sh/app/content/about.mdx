#### About

<TextLogo /> aims to become a free & more comfortable way to study kanji reading and writing. When I started my Kanji study,
hundreds of free resources were available online but were filled with distracting advertisements. It was distracting,
not letting me focus on my studies. So, I made a small script to create PDFs; with lots of motivation from my friends and colleagues,
I published the website for myself and others wanting to study kanji distraction-free. Later, I moved it to the
organization RionLabs along with other projects to manage them under one umbrella.

Plenty of worksheets are on the site, but if you need anything, feel free to email or open a GitHub issue.

### How can you help?

Being free & open source, we need all the help we can get. You can support us in many ways.

##### Buy me Sushi

I work on <TextLogo /> in my free time, and it took me a considerable amount of time
to build up to this point. You can fuel <TextLogo /> by buying me some Sushi. It
also covers costs for servers, domain, and keeps me motivated to put more time to
improve <TextLogo />.
